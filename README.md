# Explainable-AI-XAI-and-facial-recognition
This project focuses on explainable AI (XAI) and bias of the models. We believe that explainability of a model can provide insights into why it can be constructing biased decisions, and how to prevent them. Within this approach, we train a neural net on facial recognition, as facial recognition models are often prone to racial bias.
